This is a script to run a program with a bunch of different arguments, and
produce timing data in a simple line-oriented format. Perhaps you want to
illustrate your talk with some graphs showing program behaviour before and
after your clever optimizations.

Usage:

	timegraph.pl [command to measure] arg1 arg2 arg3 arg4

For instance:

	timegraph.pl sleep {1..10} > sleep.gph

After approximately 55 seconds, the file sleep.gph will contain something like

Argument	Time
1	1.005397
2	2.00559
3	3.005549
4	4.005634
5	5.011896
6	6.0073
7	7.016818
8	8.013662
9	9.008593
10	10.011329

To plot this in GNU R, start up an R session and type

s = read.table('sleep.gph', header=TRUE)
plot(s)
